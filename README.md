I'm actually learning React JS. 

To this purpose, I create a simple recipe book app. I'm using an external free API for the data [Edadam](https://developer.edamam.com/).

This project is available [here](https://book-recipes.netlify.app/).

To deploy the project, I use [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/).

 

## What did I use from React ? 

  In this app, I used some kind of element of React JS like : 
  
 - State, Effect
 - Props
 - Router, Link

## Functionnal component:

 - Search form
 - List of Recipes
 - Recipe-card
 - Recipe detail

## If you want to install this app

You need to clone the github

    git clone https://github.com/Paul-D-Dev/Book-recipes.git
 
 Install modules 
 
    npm install

Run the app locally 

    npm start
